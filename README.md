# React Widget Collection

This app is really just a container for a few different widgets I built, including:

- An Accordion-style component for displaying (specifically, hiding/showing) content
- A Wikipedia-powered Search app
- A custom dropdown-style component
- A Google Translate API-powered translator app

The purpose of this project was to get personal, hands-on reinforcement of my knowledge of the following topics:

- Hooks in React! (specifically: useState, useEffect, useRef)
- Dynamically toggling classes using state
- Async code in useEffect
- dangerouslySetInnerHTML + XSS attacks in React
- Throttling API requests
- Event Bubbling
- Debouncing
